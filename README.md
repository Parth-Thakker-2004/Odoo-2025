## Overview
The **Skill Swap Platform** is a web-based application developed for the **Odoo Hackathon '25**. It enables users to list their skills, request skills from others, and connect through a seamless skill-swapping system. Built with a modern tech stack, this platform promotes collaborative learning and community engagement by facilitating skill exchanges with features like user profiles, skill-based search, swap request management, and feedback submission.

This project was designed with a focus on user experience, leveraging **Next.js** for the frontend, **MongoDB** for the database, and **shadcn/ui** for reusable UI components.

## Features
- **User Profiles**: Users can create profiles with name, optional location and photo, skills offered, skills wanted, availability (e.g., weekends, evenings), and toggle profile visibility (public/private).
- **Skill-Based Search**: Browse or search for users by skills (e.g., "Photoshop", "Excel") with filtering options for skills offered or wanted.
- **Swap Request System**: Users can send, accept, reject, or delete swap requests, with clear status indicators for pending, accepted, or rejected swaps.
- **Feedback System**: Post-swap feedback and ratings to ensure trust and quality within the community.
- **Admin Dashboard** (optional, if implemented): Admins can reject inappropriate content, ban users, monitor swaps, send platform-wide messages, and download activity reports.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) with shadcn/ui for reusable, customizable UI components.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Next.js API routes.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user profiles, skills, swap requests, and feedback.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (via shadcn/ui) for modern, responsive layouts.
